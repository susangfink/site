Simple, intentional living—one day at a time.

I share the ways I move through life with purpose: staying active, curious, and consistent. From fitness and wellness to travel, family, food, and everyday reflections, this space captures the habits and moments that shape my days. I believe in aging well, growing intentionally, and finding meaning in the ordinary.
