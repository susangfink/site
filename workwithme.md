Work With Me



I help individuals and small businesses create clean, simple websites that feel clear, calm, and easy to use.



If you like the way this site looks and feels, that is my portfolio. I designed and built it myself.



You don’t need to know anything about tech or websites—I’ll walk you through everything and handle the details.



I can help you with:

	•	A brand-new website from scratch

	•	Updating or refreshing an existing site

	•	Personal blogs or small business websites

	•	Online Resumes

	•	Simple pages that clearly explain what you offer

I focus on:

	•	Clear layout and wording

	•	Mobile-friendly design

	•	Sites that feel human, not overwhelming

If you’ve been putting this off because it feels confusing or intimidating, I’m here to help.
