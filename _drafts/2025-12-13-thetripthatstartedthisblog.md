The kids were in school and I was folding laundry. Jay, looking at his work schedule for December, randomly said "Do you want to go to D.C.?" Whenever he says Do you want to go to --insert--city--, the kids and I usually say yes. 

I was so amazed by how clean, accessible, and safe Washington, D.C. was!
