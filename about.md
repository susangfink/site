Hi, I’m Susan G. Fink.

I created this website to share the simple, intentional ways I move through life—staying active, staying curious, and staying consistent. From fitness and wellness routines to travel, family moments, food, and everyday reflections, this blog is where I capture the habits, experiences, and thoughts that shape my days.

In my 45 years, I’ve lived in many places and moved over a dozen times. Before my life as a stay-at-home mom, I was an engineer, so you’ll find plenty of nerdy references woven in alongside my perspective as a wife and mom of three. I'm also a NASM-Certified Personal Trainer (CPT) with a focus on building habits that support long-term health. 

I don't believe life is about doing things perfectly. It's about living, learning, and growing along the way. This blog is where I share my perspecitve shaped by reali life because I believe our stories and insights are worth sharing. My hope is that you’ll find these posts informational, inspirational, entertaining, and—most of all—relatable. The G is for my maiden name initial, the many goofy stories I have to share, and because I’m genuinely grateful you’re here.

I believe in aging well, moving often, and growing with intention. I’m learning to make space for myself, show up authentically, and celebrate all the things that make life meaningful—and to connect with you along the way.

Thanks for joining me!

Susan
