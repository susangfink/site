One of our favorite meals from our time living in Japan is Okinawa Taco Rice. It's everything you love about tacos but add it over a bed of sushi rice.

It's the perfect Tex-Mex and Japanese fusion and one of our go-to weeknight dinners. You can also wrap it up in onigiri or a taco sushi roll. This bowl of taco rice is from  the Red Bridge Obbligato Taco Shop in Okinawa September 2012.
