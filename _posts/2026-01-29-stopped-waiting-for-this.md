<!--more-->

I kept procrastinating fitness until all the stars would align. I had to have all the laundry done, folded and put away. All the dishes had to be washed, every weekly rotating chore had to be marked off. Only after all of those were complete would I allow myself to workout. 

This all-or-nothing mindset ended up being a hurdle that held me back for years. 

One day, I finally let go of this requirement. I decided I had to put blinders on but instead of actual blinders, it was my gym clothes. That’s when everything changed.

<i>I stopped waiting for the house to be perfect.</i> 

The reality is, the house is never going to be perfect. If I waited for that moment, my entire life would pass me by. There will always be something to clean, organize, declutter, or fix. I didn't want my fitness momentum to be stalled by the state of the house anymore. 

Fitness and your health won't wait but the chores will still be there. This is your sign to start before everything else is done.
