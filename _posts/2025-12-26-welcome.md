Welcome to my new blog and website. 

I have to be honest. I've actually been blogging for 15 years now. I've written and posted about new mom life, photography, family portrait sessions, organizing, gardening, running and fitness. 

So where are all those posts? They're everywhere and nowhere all at once. They're micro-posts on Instagram and exist as lengthy, but clever, captions on Facebook photos. 

I realized it was time to stop limiting myself to one topic when what I really wanted to write about is my lifestyle, reflections, and go into much more detail than captions allow. 

I'm excited for this new setup! It's the simplest hosting platform I could find. I'm looking forward to how easy it is to maintain which will mean staying consistent with posting. I have a lot to share!
