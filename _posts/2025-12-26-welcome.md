Welcome to my new blog and website. 

I have something to admit. I've been blogging for 15 years now. I've written and posted about new mom life, photography, family portrait sessions, food, organizing, gardening, running and fitness. 

So where are all those posts? They're everywhere as micro-posts on Instagram and exist as lengthy captions on Facebook photos. Most of my posts, unfortunately, disappeared when I terminated subscription-based hosted blog sites. I'm excited for this new setup because it's simpler and straightforward to maintain which means focusing on content will be easier!

I realized it was time to stop limiting myself to one topic when what I really wanted to write about is my lifestyle, reflections, and go into much more detail than captions allow. I have a lot to share!
