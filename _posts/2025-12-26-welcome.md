I'm so glad you're here! Welcome to my new blog and website. 

I have to be honest. I've actually been blogging for 15 years now. I've written and posted about new mom life, photography and family portrait sessions, organizing, gardening, less plastic waste, running and fitness. 

So where are all those posts? They're everywhere and nowhere all at once. They're on Instagram and posted on Facebook embedded within clever captions. 

I realized it was time to stop limiting myself to one topic when what I really wanted to write about is my lifestyle and reflections. I couldn't stay in one lane and a narrow niche felt so restricting. 

I'm excited for this new setup because it's the simplest platform I could find. I created this blog website using a less common hosting platform, GitHub.
