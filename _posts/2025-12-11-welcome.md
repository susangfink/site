I have a confession.

This isn’t the first blog I’ve started. I’ve been blogging on and off for 15 years now. 

I’ve written and posted about new mom life, photography, organizing, gardening, running. 

So where are all those posts? They’re everywhere and nowhere all at once. They’re in Instagram, they’re posted on Facebook embedded within clever captions.  

I realized it was time to stop limiting myself to one topic when what I really wanted to write about was my life, fitness, and reflections. I failed at keeping myself in one late each time sticking to, what felt like, a narrow niche. 

I’m excited for this new setup. I’m glad you’re here and I have so much to share.
