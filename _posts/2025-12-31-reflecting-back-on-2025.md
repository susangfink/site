As 2025 comes to a close, my heart is overflowing with gratitude. It was a year of personal bests, unforgettable travel, and precious moments with family. Looking back, I’m reminded that life’s joys often come from the small, intentional choices we make whether that’s showing up to a long run, seizing a travel opportunity, or prioritizing time with loved ones.

Chasing Personal Bests, One Mile at a Time

From January to March, I trained for and completed the most miles I’ve ever finished in training. Every week’s long run felt like a challenge, but finishing each one became a mini accomplishment. For someone like me, who’s never been a fast runner, the hours spent logging miles felt both grueling and incredibly rewarding.

Showing up at the start line of the LA Marathon on March 16, healthy and injury-free, was a moment I’ll never forget. After living in California for most of my life, I never imagined I’d see Los Angeles on my own two feet in a race. Every mile was a reminder of the memories tied to the city and the personal growth along the way.

If you’ve ever trained for something that felt just a little beyond your reach, you know the mix of doubt and excitement that comes with it. Showing up, even on the days you’re tired or unsure, is where growth really happens. The marathon does't start at the start line. It was a marathon all along during the months of training.

A Year of Unplanned Adventures

2025 was also a year of unexpected travel! From Las Vegas to Beverly Hills, Cabo San Lucas, New York, Rome, Vatican City, Zion National Park, Panama City Beach, Washington D.C., and multiple trips to Los Angeles, we tried to seize every chance to explore. All of these trips were finalized within a few weeks (or days) of departure and it all worked out as planned. The itineraries were fickle and dynamic but miraculously came to fruition proving that if it's in God's will, it will happen. 

Our bags were never fully unpacked before being repacked for the next trip. The chaos of adventure is sometimes part of the fun. Traveling is a reminder that life is fleeting, and showing up for experiences—even if it’s sleep deprived—is a gift.

The Lessons in Recovery

October wasn’t easy. I spent the month sick with the flu and also had a shoulder injury. Four weeks of slowed momentum were humbling. Recovering reminded me that health is not guaranteed, and that the small gains we often take for granted are actually victories.

This period also made the decision to cancel my December marathon clear. While it was disappointing, I was grateful for the ability to rest, recover, and even get a refund. Sometimes, letting go is the bravest choice we can make for ourselves.

Family Time: The True Gift

Amid training, travel, and recovery, time with family was the most meaningful part of 2025. We were able to take the kids to see both sets of grandparents, their aunts and their little cousin. I am thankful that they are all in good health. 

If you’re reading this, maybe you’ve also felt like life is a whirlwind. This year reminded me that even small moments count. Whether it’s finishing a long run, savoring a meal with family, or taking a trip, it’s all worth it! I am thankful for the gifts of 2025 and for making it through the year.
