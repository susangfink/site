As 2025 comes to a close, my heart is overflowing with gratitude. It was a year of personal bests, unforgettable travel, and precious moments with family. Looking back, I’m reminded that life’s joys often come from the small, intentional choices we make whether that’s showing up to a long run, seizing a travel opportunity, or prioritizing time with loved ones.

<b><u> Chasing Personal Bests, One Mile at a Time</u></b>

From January to March, I trained for and completed the most miles I’ve ever finished in training. Every week’s long run felt like a challenge, but finishing each one became a mini accomplishment. For someone like me, who has never been a fast runner, the hours spent logging miles felt both grueling and incredibly rewarding.

Showing up at the start line of the LA Marathon on March 16, healthy and injury-free, was a moment I’ll never forget. After living in California for most of my life, I never imagined I’d see Los Angeles on my own two feet participating in a race. Every mile was a reminder of the memories tied to the city and the personal growth along the way.

If you’ve ever trained for something that felt just a little beyond your reach, you know the mix of doubt and excitement that comes with it. Showing up, even on the days you’re tired, is where growth really happens. The marathon doesn't start at the start line because it was a marathon all along throughout the months of training. 

<b><u>A Year of Unplanned Adventures</u></b>

2025 was also a year of unexpected travel! From Las Vegas to Beverly Hills, Cabo San Lucas, New York, Rome, Vatican City, Zion National Park, Panama City Beach, Washington D.C., and multiple trips to Los Angeles, we tried to seize every chance to explore. All of these trips were finalized within a few weeks (or days) of departure and it all worked out as planned. The itineraries were fickle and dynamic but miraculously came to fruition proving that if it's in God's will, it will happen. 

Our bags were never fully unpacked before being repacked for the next trip. I dreaded the packing and planning outfits for a family of 5 but the chaos was part of the adventure. Traveling is a reminder that life is fleeting, and showing up for experiences—even if it’s sleep deprived—is a gift. 

<b><u>The Lessons in Recovery</u></b>

October wasn’t easy. I spent the entire month sick with the flu and also had a shoulder injury. Four weeks of slowed momentum were humbling. Recovering reminded me that health is not guaranteed and that the small gains we often take for granted are actually victories.

This month of sickness also validated the decision to cancel my December marathon. While it was disappointing, I was grateful for the ability to rest, recover, and even get a refund. Sometimes, letting go is the bravest choice we can make for ourselves.

<b><u>Family Time: The True Gift</u></b>

Amid training, travel, and recovery, time with family was the most meaningful part of 2025. We were able to take the kids to see both sets of grandparents, their aunts, uncle and their little cousin. I am thankful that they are all in good health. 

This year reminded me that even small moments count. Whether it’s finishing a long run, savoring a meal with family, or taking a trip, it’s all worth it! I am thankful for the gifts of 2025 and for making it through the year.
