Some days stretch you thin, and it feels like there are more things to do than hours in the day. It’s easy to get caught up in everything going on in our lives and forget that these days are fleeting.

I had one of those days today. It felt like I barely got through anything around the house before it was already time to pick up the kids. To most people who work outside the home, it might seem like stay-at-home parents have all the time in the world to get things done. I used to think that too, back when I worked a desk job.

The truth is, the work at home is endless—but I’ll save that topic for a future post.

Sitting here with tomorrow’s already full to-do list, I’m reminded that these hectic schedules will change. Kids will grow into young adults, and I’ll look back on these teen years the way I already look back on the toddler days.

These days won’t last forever. The ones that stretch you thin, and the ones that fill you up. The ones you count down until bedtime, and the ones you wish you could slow down. It’s a truth that holds both comfort and grief, reminding us that nothing stays—neither the stress nor the sweetness of the life we’re living right now.
