I went to the pantry today to put away some snacks. It ended up being a 2 hour pantry overhaul where I took out more than half the items to declutter and reorganize.

I kept moving as fast as I could to see if I could make a difference in tidying. The part that really took me by surprise is that each item I attempted to decant ended up being a perfect pour that did not overflow. 

The onion powder was transferred exactly to the top of the spice jar shaker. I kept going and tried it with each other pantry staple I came across. Vinegar poured perfectly from the gallon jar into the smaller jug. The same thing happened with Panko Bread Crumbs, Cocoa Chocolate, and the LavAzza Espresso powder. I usually like taking before and after photos but this time I ended up reflecting on a bible verse. 

<i>“God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”</i> <b>Romans 5:5</b>
