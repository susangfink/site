I went to the pantry today to put away a few snacks. It quickly turned into a two-hour overhaul where I cleared out more than half the shelves to declutter and reorganize. I kept moving quickly, as if I were racing myself, curious to see if I could actually make a dent in the mess.

What surprised me most was what happened when I began to decant. Every single item poured perfectly—nothing overflowed, nothing fell short. If you’ve ever tried to organize a pantry for aesthetics, you know that’s rarely how it goes.

Every grain of onion powder transferred cleanly to the very top of its spice jar. Vinegar poured seamlessly from a gallon jug into a smaller one. The same happened with panko bread crumbs, cocoa powder, and even the Lavazza espresso. Each pour fit exactly as it was meant to.

Halfway through, I realized I’d forgotten to take a before photo. Instead, I found myself reflecting on a Bible verse and how blessings can appear when things pour just right:
<blockquote>
<i>“God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”
<b>Romans 5:5</i></b>
</blockquote>

This kind of organizing would normally frustrate me—especially when it means discovering bags of stale tortilla chips. But today, I chose to notice the blessings in each pour instead.

Even in the smallest, most ordinary tasks, there are moments where we can feel God’s presence and be reminded that He is with us.
