I went to the pantry today to put away some snacks. It ended up being a 2 hour pantry overhaul where I took out more than half the items to declutter and reorganize.

I kept moving as fast as I could to see if I could make a difference in tidying. The part that really took me by surprise is that each item I attempted to decant ended up being a perfect pour that did not overflow. If you've tried to organize a pantry before for aesthetics, then you probably know the struggle of not fitting everything when you go to decant. 

Every grain of the onion powder was transferred exactly to the top of its own spice jar shaker. I kept going and tried it with each other pantry staple I came across. Vinegar poured perfectly from the gallon jar into the smaller jug. The same thing happened with Panko Bread Crumbs, Cocoa Chocolate, and the LavAzza Espresso powder. Halfway through all this pantry work, I realized I forgot to take a before picture. Instead, I ended up reflecting on a bible verse and how blessings happen when we pour perfectly.  

<i>“God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”</i> <b>Romans 5:5</b>

This type of organizing would usually make me mad at finidng bags of stale tortilla chips but I chose to feel the blessings of each pour instead. Even in the smallest tasks, we can find that there are ways to feel God's presence and know that He is with us.
